## System Description

The Alcon NGENUITY&trade; 3D Visualization System is a 3D stereoscopic, high-definition digital video camera and workstation that operates as an adjunct to a surgical microscope during surgery. The system displays real-time images or images from recordings on a flat-panel, high-definition digital 3D display device, positioned for viewing video. There is no additional light (or energy) delivered by the system.

## Intended Use

The NGENUITY&trade; 3D Visualization System is intended to aid trained surgeons in visualization during ophthalmic surgery.

## Indications for Use

The NGENUITY&trade; 3D Visualization System is indicated for providing magnified stereoscopic images of objects in real time or from recordings. It may also display non-diagnostic information from validated Alcon systems.

## Contraindications

There are no contraindications at this time.

## Clinical Benefits

The intended clinical benefit of the NGENUITY&trade; 3D Visualization System is to allow users to visualize ophthalmic surgery by looking at a display screen rather than in standard microscope oculars for improved ergonomic benefit.

## Environmental Considerations

Keep the system dry and protect it from harmful ingress of water. The camera includes a rating of IPX1: protection against vertically falling drops of water.
