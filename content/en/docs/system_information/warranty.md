Alcon Laboratories, Inc., will repair or replace at its option, any system or accompanying accessories found to be defective in material and/or workmanship for a period of one (1) year from the date of initial installation. This warranty applies to the original purchaser of the system, when said system is properly installed, maintained, and operated in accordance with published instructions.

Alcon Laboratories shall not be obligated to provide services under this warranty for damage to or destruction of systems covered where such damage or destruction is (i) a result of or caused by fire or explosion of any origin, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, war, or any Act of God including, but not limited to lightning, windstorm, hail, flood, earthquake, or (ii) caused by customer’s misuse or improper servicing of said systems.

This warranty does not cover damage resulting from service repair or other alteration by any person other than an Alcon-authorized service person, and any warranties provided by Alcon with respect to this equipment shall become void and of no further force and effect if this equipment is serviced by anyone other than Alcon-authorized service personnel. In particular, Alcon shall have no obligation to replace, repair or credit customer’s account for the cost of the equipment, which has been subject to service or other alteration by persons other than Alcon-authorized service personnel.

The express warranty above is the sole warranty obligation of Alcon, and the remedy provided above is in lieu of any and all other remedies. There are no other agreements, guarantees, or warranties - oral or written, express or implied - including without limitation warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Alcon shall have no liability whatsoever for any incidental or consequential damages arising out of any defect, improper use, or unauthorized service or repair.
