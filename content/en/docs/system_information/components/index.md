At a minimum, the system includes the cart, camera, microscope, 3D glasses, keyboard, and touchpad. To optimize operation, incorporate additional devices such as the following:

![Example System](system_with_callouts.svg)

{{< callout num="1" term="System" desc="Receives video from the camera and displays 3D images." >}}  
{{< callout num="2" term="Patient Bed" desc="Holds the patient at a comfortable level." >}}  
{{< callout num="3" term="Microscope stand" desc="Suspends a microscope above the patient." >}}  
{{< callout num="4" term="Camera" desc="Captures 3D video." >}}  
{{< callout num="5" term="Microscope" desc="Magnifies the view of the camera." >}}

## Camera

The camera is a stereoscopic 3D camera with high dynamic range. Mount the camera on a surgical microscope.

{{< callout num="2" term="Strain relief screw" desc="Holds the camera cable in place to reduce stress on the cable connection." >}}  
{{< callout num="3" term="USB camera connector" desc="Connects the camera to the cart." >}}  
{{< callout num="4" term="Iris slider" desc="Adjusts light exposure captured by the camera. Alcon recommends setting the iris slider to 30%." >}}

## Cart

The cart receives video input from the camera and additional data from other connected devices, and then outputs the results on the monitor.

{{< callout num="6" term="Power cable coil" desc="Routes the power cable for system storage and transportation." >}}  
{{< callout num="7" term="External USB drive connectors" desc="Provide connections for external USB drives to save profiles, recorded videos, or snapshots." >}}  
{{< callout num="8" term="Power switch" desc="Turns the system on or off." >}}  
{{< callout num="9" term="Casters (4)" desc="Rotate and move freely to provide extensive mobility for the cart." >}}

## Displays

Depending on the display model, the system connects to the display either through DisplayPort input 1 or both the HDMI input 3 and COMM cable connector. The system also supports a secondary display to either duplicate the primary display view or show a subset of features.

## Glasses

3D images require passive, circularly-polarized 3D glasses. If necessary, wear the 3D glasses over prescription glasses.

{{% panel status="caution" title="CAUTION" %}}

* To ensure optimal image quality, the system should only be used with Alcon-supplied 3D glasses. Contact Alcon if additional pairs are required. Polarized prescription glasses will distort the 3D effect and should not be used.
* The 3D glasses must be worn in front of the laser protective eyewear to avoid distorting the 3D effect.

## Keyboard and Mouse

The system includes both a wired and a wireless keyboard with an integrated touchpad. The wireless keyboard is and the battery indicator displays the charge level while the keyboard is on.

{{< callout num="1" term="Power indicator" desc="Lights according to the battery status" >}}  

* **Blinking green** &ndash; The battery is charging.  
* **Solid green** &ndash; The battery has adequate charge.  
* **Blinking red** &ndash; The battery power is low. Recharge the battery.  

{{< callout num="2" term="USB connector (rear)" desc="Connects the keyboard to a power source to recharge the batteries." >}}  
{{< callout num="3" term="USB connector (bottom)" desc="Powers the wireless keyboard with 2 AAA batteries." >}}  
{{< callout num="4" term="Power switch" desc="Turns the keyboard on or off." >}}  
{{< callout num="5" term="Touchpad" desc="Controls the system cursor." >}}  

## DataFusion

The Constellation&trade;, Centurion&trade;, and ORA SYSTEM&trade; provide additional patient and surgical operation information to display on the system. The Constellation&trade; and Centurion&trade; systems displays the information on the surgical screen while the ORA SYSTEM&trade; displays the information in PiP or split screen layouts. The Constellation&trade; also controls basic system functions. The ORA SYSTEM&trade; dynamic reticle displays on the live image (activate on the ORA SYSTEM&trade;).

## Footswitch (Optional)

The footswitch performs basic functions during operation through controls operated by a foot.

{{< callout num="3" term="Left pedal" desc="Cycles to the previous imaging mode." >}}  
{{< callout num="4" term="Right pedal" desc="Cycles to the next imaging mode." >}}

## Accessories

The system may include the following accessories:

* **Lens cap** &ndash; Protects the camera lens.
* **Cable straps** &ndash; Secure the camera cable to the microscope.
* **Cable hooks** &ndash; Route loose cables or coil cable for storage or transportation.

* **Wired keyboard** &ndash; Controls the system.
* **USB extension cable** &ndash; Powers the wireless keyboard or extends other USB connections.
* **Fabric target** &ndash; Helps check the color, focus, and depth of field of the microscope.
* **White balance card** &ndash; Helps with setting the system white balance and for focus and alignment.
* **Thumbscrew** &ndash; Secures the camera to the microscope.
* **DataFusion cables** &ndash; Connect a Constellation&trade; (Ethernet) or ORA SYSTEM&trade; (HDMI).
