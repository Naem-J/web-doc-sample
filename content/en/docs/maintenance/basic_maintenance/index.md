## Microscope Alignment

Use the microscope controls to focus the image on-screen. If the image still appears out of focus or blurry, check the camera alignment using the crosshair target on the back of the white balance card.
1. Put on 3D glasses and ensure a live image is observed on the system.
2. Place the crosshair target face-up on a flat surface.
3. Center the microscope field of view on the crosshair. Align the horizontal and vertical bars with the field of view.
4. Focus microscope as best as possible on the crosshair target at typical working distance.
5. Remove the 3D glasses and view the image on the screen.
6. Compare the horizontal lines on-screen with the image below. Ensure the horizontal lines are overlap.

## Image Retention

Image retention is similar to a screen burn or ghosting shown on the display. To refresh the display pixels, press the **Power** button either on the display for about 3 seconds or the remote control. The display power indicator flashes while the process is in progress.
