## Camera Sensor Initialization

Sensor initialization helps prevent image degradation and noise. Perform the following steps during startup or after camera connection. A message to expose the camera to more light appears.

{{< panel status="notice" title="NOTE" >}}Image quality is also influenced by other factors.{{< /panel >}}

1. Turn on all room lights.
2. Open the camera iris to 100%.
3. Position the white balance card at 90 degrees under the microscope objective lens. The message disappears within 5 seconds.

    {{< panel status="notice" title="NOTE" >}}If the message does not disappear, increase the microscope illumination intensity until it does.{{< /panel >}}

4. Set the camera iris to 30%.

## Camera Pan

The camera pan function adjusts the alignment of the image without moving the camera or microscope mount. The range of image movement is limited.

The pan function is useful in the following cases:

* In retina cases, where the wide angle lens is not centered in the optical path.
* In minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures when gonioscopy lens image is not centered in optical path.

Use **Ctrl**+**Up**, **Ctrl**+**Right**, **Ctrl**+**Down**, or **Ctrl**+**Left** to electronically move the image.
